# MIDAS-Arduino
Arduino code for an Arduino-based smart mirror.

### Dependencies
The project requires the 3rd party library for the Gameduino board which can be dowloaded [here](http://www.excamera.com/files/gameduino/synth/sketches/Gameduino.zip)

#### Other Repositories
The project makes use of a cloud backend.
The source for it can be found [here](https://github.com/ipriel/MIDAS-Cloud).
It is possible to use your own backend, with minor modification at most.
